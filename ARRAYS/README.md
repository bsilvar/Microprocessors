## Program A
Write a C program to input n numbers in an array, calculate the
sum of all even numbers and all odd numbers in the array and
print the larger sum. 
Example: If the array contains the following
elements: 2, 3, 3, 5, 4, 8, 7, 11, 2 The sum of all even elements is
2+4+8+2=16 Sum of all odd elements is 3+3+5+7+11=29.
Therefore, the output should be 29

## Program B
Write a C program that take 2 integer arrays A[] and B[] each with
ten integers as input and prints results of following set operations:
1. A union B (Write function set_union())
2. A intersection B (Write function set_intersection())
3. A-B and B-A (Write function set_difference())

## Program C
Write 2 different C functions to compute area and perimeter of a
triangle whose sides a, b, and c are given by user as inputs.
Formula to compute perimeter = a + b + c
Formula to compute area = [s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]0.5 Where s = 0.5 *
(a+b+c)
Function prototypes are:
double perim(double a, double b, double c)
double area(double a, double b, double c)
Your program should read the input data and print the output
data via separate functions. 
The prototypes are:
double read_input()
double print_value(double val)

## Program D
Write a program that reads from the user 10 integers and stores them in
an array and extracts the first even and odd numbers and their index and
prints them

## Program E
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer number and counts number
of ones and prints it to the user. So if the entered number is 5 (0b101) the
output is 2 because the binary representation of 5 contains 2 ones
